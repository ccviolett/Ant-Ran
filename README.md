## Ant-Ran

#### Description

This theme is based on [Ant](https://github.com/EliverLara/Ant). Many thanks to [EliverLara](https://github.com/EliverLara).

This dream is made for Ran. Now is for world.

#### What's different?

Ant is a wonderful theme for GTK*, it's doing well in all respects.

But the only problem is that its main color is red.

Someone who prefers blue rather than red thinks it can look more grace if it can change the main color to blue.

I know Ant has many different versions, like Ant-Dracula, Ant-Nebula, Ant-Bloody. and there is a theme between them whose main color is blue but it is a dark theme.

So I made a new light theme base on Ant using blue for the main color.

Hope you like it.

#### Installation

Extract the zip file to the themes directory i.e. `/usr/share/themes/` or `~/.themes/` (create it  if necessary).

To set the theme in Gnome, run the following commands in Terminal,

```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Ant"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme "Ant"
```
or Change via distribution specific tool.
